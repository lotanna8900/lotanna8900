# 👋 Hey, I'm Lotanna

I am a **Senior Product Engineer** and **AI Systems Architect** focused on building complex, stateful systems.
I operate at the intersection of **Autonomous Agents**, **Interactive Narrative Engines**, and **Full-Stack Architecture**.

### 🧩 What I Do

* 🤖 **AI Systems Architecture:** Core Contributor to **[adenhq/hive](https://github.com/adenhq/hive)**, architecting safety protocols (`EvolutionGuard`) for self-evolving agents.
* ⚙️ **Engine Development:** Building **Lota Labs**, a custom node-based runtime that compiles interactive fiction into blockchain-reactive applications.
* 🚀 **Full-Stack Product:** Shipping scalable, production-grade applications using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Python**, and **Supabase**.
